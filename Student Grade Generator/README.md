## About The Project

Based on the marks that the user has entered, this JavaScript code determines the grade. The user is prompted to enter their scores on a scale of 0 to 100. The code then runs an integrity check to ensure the accuracy of the input, computes the appropriate grade, and presents the result to the user.

### Built With

This project was build using: 

1. HTML
2. JavaScript


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## How it Works
This is how the program works:

1. The "Calculate Grade" button which can be associated with the functionality of this program is clicked by the user, which calls the getGrade function.
2. When the user is prompted to submit their marks, the function puts the data in the marks variable.
3. The parseFloat function is used to transform the marks variable into a floating-point number.
4. The input is verified by an integrity check. An alert is shown and the function ends early if the mark is not a number or goes outside the range of 0 to 100.
5. The code uses conditional statements (if and else if) to assign a grade to the grade variable based on the mark value.
6. An alert informs the user of the calculated grade.


### Installation

1. Optional git software in vscode can be installed in order to clone a repository to the local machine.
