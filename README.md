# Code Challenges Repository

Welcome to the Code Challenges Repository! This repository contains three different folders, each focusing on a specific code challenge. Below is a detailed description of each challenge:

## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

The Student Grade Generator is a function that prompts the user to input student marks and assigns the corresponding grade based on the marks. The grading system is as follows:
- A: Marks greater than 79
- B: Marks between 60 and 79 (inclusive)
- C: Marks between 49 and 59 (inclusive)
- D: Marks between 40 and 49 (inclusive)
- E: Marks less than 40

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

The Speed Detector program takes the speed of a car as input and determines if the driver is speeding. If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints "Ok". However, if the speed exceeds the limit, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), the driver receives one demerit point. The program also displays the total number of demerit points. If the driver has more than 12 points, the program prints "License suspended".


## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

The Net Salary Calculator program calculates an individual's net salary based on the inputs of basic salary and benefits. It takes into account the payee (tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary, and net salary. The specific calculations may vary depending on the tax and deduction rates applicable in your region.


Feel free to explore each challenge folder for more details and the respective code implementations.
